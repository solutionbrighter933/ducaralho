  # Fix RLS Policies to Prevent Infinite Recursion

  1. Problem Analysis
    - Current policies on `profiles` table are causing infinite recursion
    - The issue occurs when policies try to query the same table they're protecting
    - This creates a circular dependency that PostgreSQL cannot resolve

  2. Solution
    - Drop all existing problematic policies
    - Create new, non-recursive policies
    - Use direct user_id comparisons instead of subqueries where possible
    - Simplify organization access patterns

  3. Security
    - Maintain security by ensuring users can only access their own data
    - Allow organization-level access through simplified, non-recursive queries
    - Enable proper profile creation during signup process
